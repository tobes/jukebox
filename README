About
-----

This is my personal jukebox program

The aim of this project is to simply manage a music library
that is arranged into directories that fit the general pattern
of ARTIST_NAME/ALBUM_NAME/album_files. The album files should
be of some variation of "TRACK_NUMBER TITLE.ext' . If an image
file is found in the directory it will be used as album art.
For albums with various artists they are expected to be in
Various/ALBUM_NAME/album_files where the tracks are named
'TRACK_NUMBER ARTIST_NAME TITLE.ext'.

The jukebox can run in both a graphical or text based mode.
The graphical mode version also contains a 'child lock' mode
which needs to be documented. It picks random songs if the
playlist is empty.
